# Stochastic Market Simulator and Strategy Evaluation Framework
This project implements a deterministic simulation framework for modeling stochastic price processes and evaluating simple trading strategies using Monte Carlo methods. The goal is to study expected value, variance, and robustness of strategies under different market assumptions, not to predict real financial markets.

## Project Goals
- Model synthetic price processes with explicit assumptions
- Evaluate simple trading strategies through simulation
- Analyze performance distributions rather than single outcomes
